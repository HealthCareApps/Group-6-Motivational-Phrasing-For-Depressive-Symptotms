To use the app: type a username and password, then select login.
You can navigate through the menus on the app, which almost all have a back / logout button
in check yourself: use travel mode to select a font, shape, and color, then press "Check self" to get a score and motivational phrase.
In AR Mode: use one of the provided assests (if available) and put them in the camera's view. When the AR function recognizes a target, a 3D block with a motivational phrase will appear.

To set the alarm, move the clock values around and click set alarm. Press turn off to turn the alarm off.











FOR FUTURE STUDENTS WORKING ON THIS APP:

The intention of this app is to relieve depresive symptoms and motivate individuals to remain positive in a private, stress-free, self-help environment.

The app has a login page that has the user input a username and password. However, these values are not stored for personalization at this time.
The main page has 3 options. Navigation through the app is functional. The main function of the app, the self-check, has two modes: Augmented Reality, and travel mode.

Augmented Reality is possible with a few specific targets at this time, but is meant to work with cards representing the app's 10 color choices, 5 fonts, and 5 shapes.
Travel mode has the user selecting one shape, color, & font, and having them press calculate to determine a score for their current mood. This part is functional, but could be improved.
	-Firstly: there are only 5 motivational phrases: one for each possible user score. There should be multiple phrases available for each score, and the app should randomly select one.
	-Secondly: The algorithm for selecting the user score should be improved to reflect further research on the effects of shapes, colors, and fonts in humans correlating to their current state of mind.

The second function, alarm clock, shows 3 options. The second two, repeat schedule & select tone, have yet to be implemented.
	-Set Clock has been worked on heavily, but is not functional. The app does not send a delayed intent for a notification to later wake up the device.
	*The clock time is set and can be shown on a user level, but the code does not call the rest of the Android services to turn on the alarm from a device level.

User preferences includes a people despository, where the user adds people to their app and describes them, possibly helping them realize who in their live's may be a cause or source of stress and negativity.
This feature of adding people is not yet implemented.
Lastly, the app had a preference for color choice. The app should ask the user to rank the colors in the app themselves, and save values based on the user's choices.
	this feature is not currently implemented, and the values used for each color are a default value found within the travel mode java file code.
